## How to get weather data through Python in different ways.

In this repository there are 3 folders that contain files about 3 different ways to get weather data through Python. Knowing the weather data of an area is useful in many situations and if we can get this data through Python, we can handle them very easily to implement them in IoT models, energy efficiency management, home automation and more.

Let's see a brief introduction to the proposed methods, although in each folders there is a 'Readme.md' file that details each procedure in more details.

### WTTR

wttr.in is a console-oriented weather forecast service, a very interesting opensource project that allows users from anywhere in the world get weather data in a very simple way. You will find all the documentation very well explained in their GitHub profile [github.com/chubin/wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) that I recommend you to visit.

### OpenWeather

[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) is a professional online weather data management service. It has several payment plans that allow you to perform unlimited queries and access to a large database.

However, it also has a free API with which, once registered on its website, we can start enjoying this service that, although limited, is more than enough right now.

### Web Scraping

In this case we will access the [weather.com](https://weather.com/) page to extract the public data that it offers, but automatically.
